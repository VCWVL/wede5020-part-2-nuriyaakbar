1. Project Overview
This project is the development of a responsive e-commerce website for ProSport Hub, a South African retailer of sports equipment, footwear, and apparel.The goal is to create a modern, user-friendly online store that enhances product discovery, simplifies the shopping experience, and increases online sales.

This repository contains the core HTML files for the website, structured according to the business proposal prepared by Nuriya Akbar.

2. Key Features
The website includes the following pages and features based on the project plan:

Homepage (index.html): The main landing page to welcome users.
About Us Page (about.html): Contains the company's history, mission, and vision.
Products Page (product.html): A dynamic product catalog that displays items using JavaScript. 
View products page (view-product.html): This page allows the user to view the product they choose before adding it to their cart.
- Has a product description and an "Add to cart" button.

Features include:
Grid-based layout for product cards,with images and prices of the products,along with a "view" button.
A "View" button to view the product.
"Add to Cart" functionality using localStorage.
Description of the product you've decided to view and an "Add to cart" button underneath the description of the product.
A shopping cart page which displays the products in your cart along with the prices of each item,the quantity, a remove item option and a total price at the bottom.
Navigation: A consistent navigation bar allows users to access all main sections of the site, including Home, About, Enquiry, Contact, Products, and the Shopping Cart.
3. Technology Stack
The project is built using foundational web technologies as outlined in the proposal:

HTML5: For the structure and content of the web pages.
CSS3: For styling and layout (currently implemented as internal CSS in each file).
JavaScript: For dynamic functionality, such as rendering products and managing the shopping cart on the product.html page.
4. File Structure
The project currently consists of the following HTML files:

index.html
about.html
product.html
contact.html
enquiry.html
cart.html
view-product.html 


This project also consists of a style.css page,which is linked to all other pages/files.
